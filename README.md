Streaming Search Engine
=======================

This project is a streaming search engine that allows users to search for movies and TV shows across multiple streaming platforms. Users can search for a movie or TV show, and the search engine will provide information about where the content is available for streaming. Users can also add movies and TV shows to a watchlist for easy access later.
